<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
<p>When writing code I usually adhere to the Unix Design Philosophy: Do One Thing and Do It Well. This site, however, is not a tool or a utility, nor would it ever be used in any kind of workflow. Thus, I choosen to stick to the Unix philosophy for this website's design for the most part, but not religiously..</p>
