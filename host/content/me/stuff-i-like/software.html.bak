<h1>Software I Like</h1>

Software I like and would recomend to anyone.

<ul>
	<li><em>Operating System: </em>Arch Linux. It's perfect for new linux users and old timers alike. There's no better way to get a minimalist install of GNU/Linux (assuming you tolerate systemd :P).</li>
	<li><em>Window Manager: </em>Suckless DWM. Very intuitive with no bloat. It's very extensible too.</li>
	<li><em>Terminal: </em>Suckless ST. Simply the best out there. In less that 3000 LOC.</li>
	<li><em>Text Editor: </em>Vim/Neovim. If you ever edit text, vim will save you litteral hours.</li>
</ul>
