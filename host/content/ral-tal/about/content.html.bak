<h1>Content</h1>
<p>Each ral-tal issue will have arround 100 words of content. This content is written as a statement of fact, and is hopefully something you've never though about before. An issue may be a statement about philosophy, economics, politics, literature, or anything else. Because ral-tal wants to give you something you can think about until the next issue, issue contents (probalby) won't be something you've already made up your mind on. Becuase of this, ral-tal can be enjoyed by people regardless of their political or otherwise predispositions.</p>
<p>You may disagree with an issue of ral-tal. Although written as a statement of fact, no issue's statements can be proven without any doubt. If you <em>do</em> disagree, ral-tal has fulfilled it's purpose anyway. You've thought about the content, mulled it over, and come to a conclusion, so ral-tal has done it's job.</p>
