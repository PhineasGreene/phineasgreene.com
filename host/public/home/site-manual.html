<h1>Site Manual</h1>
<p>There are two methods of navigation on this site, the first are the tabs on the main navigation bar, and the second is the navigation tree.</p>
<p>The main navigation bar is above this text and has hyperlinks arranged in a row. Clicking these links will take to to a section of this site. The main navigation bar is used when you want to go to an entirely new topic on the site.</p>
<p>The second navigation method is the navigation tree. This is displayed to the left of this text. It contains hyperlinks arranged in a vertical list. This list may include sub-lists under certain topics. Clicking these links will take you to a content page on the site. The navigation tree is used for more granular navigation than the main navigation bar.</p>
