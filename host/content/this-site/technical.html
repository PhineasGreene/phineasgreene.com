<h1>Technical Information</h1>

<p>This site is made pretty much 100% from scratch. You can check out the source code here:<br><a href="https://github.com/PhineasGreene/phineasgreene.com">https://github.com/PhineasGreene/phineasgreene.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Front End</h2>

<p>The front end is just good old HTML, CSS and Javascript. Content HTML files are slotted into templates with a custom template system.</p>

<h2>Back End</h2>

<p>This site is hosted on a Vultr machine running Debian 10. The server is made with NodeJS, and uses NGINX as a reverse proxy. Certbot handles HTTPS.</p>
