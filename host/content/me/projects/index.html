<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>Some projects. Certainly not a comprehensive list. Mostly just small things I've that I think are cool.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/me/projects/obfulife.c">obfulife.c</a> is a small obfuscated C program that simulates Conway's Game of Life.</li>
	<li>pullbg.sh is a bash script that pulls backgammon matches from backgammongalaxy.com and analyses and databases them with GNU Backgammon. It is kind of hard coded to me and my build of GNU Backgammon, but it wouldn't be hard to adapt to your uses. <a href="/me/projects/pullbg.sh">pullbg.sh</a>, <a href="/me/projects/pull.js">pull.js</a>, <a href="/me/projects/commands">commands</a></li>
</ul>
